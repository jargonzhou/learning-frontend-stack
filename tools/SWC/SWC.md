> SWC (stands for Speedy Web Compiler) is a super-fast TypeScript / JavaScript compiler written in Rust. It's a library for Rust and JavaScript at the same time.
>
> SWC is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It’s used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno.
> 
> SWC can be used for both **compilation** and **bundling**. For compilation, it takes JavaScript / TypeScript files using modern JavaScript features and outputs valid code that is supported by all major browsers.
>
> SWC is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.
