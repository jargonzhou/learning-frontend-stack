> The React Framework for the Web
> 
> Used by some of the world's largest companies, Next.js enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest **React** features, and integrating powerful **Rust**-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

What is Next.js?
- Next.js is **a React framework for building full-stack web applications**. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
- It also **automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers**. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.
- Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you **build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications**.

What's in Next.js?
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic Image, Font, and Script Optimizations for improved UX and Core Web Vitals.
- **Data Fetching**: Make your React component async and await your data. Next.js supports both server and client data fetching.
- **Server Actions**: Run server code by calling a function. Skip the API. Then, easily revalidate cached data and update your UI in one network roundtrip.
- **Advanced Routing & Nested Layouts**: Create routes using the file system, including support for more advanced routing patterns and UI layouts.
- **Dynamic HTML Streaming/动态HTML流**: Instantly stream UI from the server, integrated with the App Router and React Suspense.
- **CSS Support/CSS支持**: Style your application with your favorite tools, including support for CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and popular community libraries.
- **Route Handlers/路由处理器**: Build API endpoints to securely connect with third-party services for handling auth or listening for webhooks.
- **Middleware/中间件**: Take control of the incoming request. Use code to define routing and access rules for authentication, experimentation, and internationalization.
- **React Server Components/React服务端组件**: Add components without sending additional client-side JavaScript. Built on the latest React features.
- **Client and Server Rendering/客户端和服务端渲染**: Flexible rendering and caching options, including Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), on a per-page level.
