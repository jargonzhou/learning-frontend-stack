> React Native brings React's declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.
>
> **Declarative**. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
> **Component-Based**. Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
> **Developer Velocity**. See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
> **Portability**. Reuse code across iOS, Android, and other platforms.
